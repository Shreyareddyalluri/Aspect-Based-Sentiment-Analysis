Analysis of a large amount of data has always brought value to institutions and organizations. Lately,
people’s opinions expressed through text have become a very important aspect of this analysis. In
response to this challenge, a natural language processing technique known as Aspect-Based Sentiment
Analysis (ABSA) has emerged. Having the ability to extract the polarity for each aspect of opinions
separately, ABSA has found itself useful in a wide range of domains. Education is one of the domains
in which ABSA can be successfully utilized. Being able to understand and find out what students like
and don’t like most about a course, professor, or teaching methodology can be of great importance
for the respective institutions. While this task represents a unique NLP challenge, many studies have
proposed different approaches to tackle the problem. In this work, we present a comprehensive review
of the existing work in ABSA with a focus in the education domain. A wide range of methodologies
are discussed and conclusions are drawn.
